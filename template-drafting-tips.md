## Drafting CodePact Templates

The modular format of CodePact documents seems to lend itself to certain drafting conventions.

- Each clause should do one thing and do it well.

- If the template is for non-lawyer use, topics should be broken up by "commercial decision" rather than "legal concept".

- Don't try and cram too many variables / outcomes into a clause.  If the clause summary needs to change to capture the extra outcomes that a variable could introduce, you likely need another option.

-  If you use a variable more than once in a document, you should define a term and put the variable in the definition.
